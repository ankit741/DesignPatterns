# Design Patterns
Design patterns, as name suggest, are solutions for most commonly (and frequently) occurred problems while designing a software.

# There are mainly three types of design patterns:

# Creational patterns
These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

# Structural patterns
These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

# Behavioral patterns
These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

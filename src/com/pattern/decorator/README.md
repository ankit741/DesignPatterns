#Name
Decorator Design Pattern
#Type
Structural design pattern.
#Design Principle
Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
#About
Decorator pattern allows adding additional behaviors to objects dynamically at runtime without affecting other object of same type by placing them inside wrapper objects.
Basically, Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically and provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
#JDK Example
InputStream is a Base abstract Class and FilterInputStream is a decorator class extended by child classes like BufferedInputStream.
